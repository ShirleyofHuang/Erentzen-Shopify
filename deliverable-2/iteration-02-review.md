# Team 08-Erentzen

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2021/03/14
 * Where: Online(Zoom)

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
We use Trello to manage and track our tasks. Trello creates a shared task board for collaboration. By updating the task cards, group members can work responsively without causing any disruptions which highly boosts our efficiency.
We schedule team meetings at a fixed time before the weekly partner meetings. We summarize our problems and progress within the week in our team meetings to ensure effective and efficient communication in the following partner meeting. We set a fixed schedule to better accommodate everyone's plan. 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
Some of the group members use Slack through the web browser. Slack is the only way we connect with our partner besides email and members don’t stay active on Slack all the time. This leads to a late reply and the lack of communication on Slack that we and our partner can’t get an immediate response on both sides. 
We didn’t commit on a regular and regulated basis. Frequent and explicit commit to the development branch can better update the work with other members and it’s easier to trace back.
We split up the work without putting the design as a whole. Each team member was initially assigned for one single web page design. We have to think back on the connection between components afterwards which is avoidable if we planned on the project scope.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
more frequent communication/slack activity
encouraging commits and meaningful commit messages
meeting minute

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo
The demo was shared with the partner on the deployed site before meeting. Each member prepared the demo of the component they developed. 
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
We managed to demo all the features in the prototype that was approved by our partner with improvements.
We demoed each feature on local servers and shared the screen with our partner on Zoom, and our partner could also use the demo on the deployed site. 
 * Did your partner accept the features?
Our partner accepted all the features, but also gave us some feedback for improvement.  
 * Were there change requests?
There were several UI changes requested by our partner to improve user experience. 
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
The developers of each feature know the best of how to demonstrate their work, so each person should continue to demo the features they wrote.
We should ask more questions on partner’s preferences during the demo instead of waiting for our partner to give us feedback. 
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
